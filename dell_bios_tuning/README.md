This is a playbook to tune the BIOS settings of a Dell server for VMware vSphere. Mainly, it gives the CPU Power Management into the control of the Hypervisor.

Tested with ansible 2.9.5 and Dell PowerEdge R740xd but should also work for other 14th generation PowerEdge servers and ansible 2.8.

See it at work with `asciinema play ansible-dell-bios.cast`.
